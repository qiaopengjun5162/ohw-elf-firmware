## What is OHW?

OHW (Open Hardware Wallet) is a fully open-source, non-commercial hardware wallet project. Our mission is to help you create your own hardware wallet.

Unlike commercial hardware products where open-source is used to drive sales of their commercial products, our open-source focus is on building infrastructure.

We don't restrict users to specific chip manufacturers or models. Users have the freedom to choose from over 200 chips from more than 10 manufacturers, and can work with over 3000 development boards made by chip manufacturers or third parties. For example, popular open hardware platforms like Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

Users can also create their own development boards based on our reference designs, which we will soon release.

The Open Hardware Wallet supports multiple hardware architectures and is optimized for resource-constrained devices with security built-in. The cheapest supported MCU costs only $0.3, with optional support for Bluetooth, WiFi, and display capabilities.

## What can this product do?

We are building core infrastructure connecting blockchain with physical devices. Not just a hardware wallet.

## How to Use the Firmware

### Pre-compiled Firmware

  We provide pre-compiled firmware for development boards we own. Please check the [Releases](https://github.com/butterfly-communtiy/ohw-elf-firmware/releases) section on the right or see below for our available development boards.

### Self-compiled Firmware

  If your development board is not included in pre-compiled firmware, please check the following links to set up the development environment and compile firmware for your board.

#### Getting Started

  [https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)

 `eesp32c3_luatos_core` is our recommended development board. For other boards, please check the [Supported Boards](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html).

If you have completed the steps in the link above, try compiling the example with this command.

```bash
west build -p always -b esp32c3_luatos_core/esp32c3/usb samples/hello_world
```

 **This project also requires additional Rust configuration. please refer here.**

[  https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

  [https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr-lang-rust/discussions/11#discussioncomment-10905800](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr-lang-rust/discussions/11#discussioncomment-10905800)

  **Also refer to** **[Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)**

#### Compile ohw

1. Clone source code

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/butterfly-communtiy/ohw-elf-firmware.git
   ```
2. Set environment variables

   > Please refer to [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/env_vars.html#zephyr-environment-scripts) for the Windows environment.
   >

   ```bash
   # Mac or Linux environment
   source ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/zephyr-env.sh
   ```
3. Compile ohw source code

   ```bash
   west build -p always -b esp32c3_luatos_core/esp32c3/usb
   ```
4. Flash

   ```bash
   west flash
   ```

### Development Boards

We carefully selected 5 development boards representing 3 different architectures from 5 different chip manufacturers as our officially supported boards. This demonstrates our vendor-independent capability. Our developers actively develop and test on these boards.

We also provide direct support for over 300 development boards without any modifications needed. For a complete list, please check our [Supported Boards](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html) documentation.

Due to the wide variety of development board models available, only the chip price is listed here. Please select your preferred development board.

**If you have a recommended development board, here's a [quick guide to get started](https://github.com/butterfly-communtiy/ohw-elf-firmware/tree/master/doc/board).**

By default, the chip on the development board is not security-locked and has no security features enabled.

Each chip model has its own specific locking protocol that varies by manufacturer. Please refer to your chip's technical documentation.

We cannot assist with chip locking at this time. **Please note that this matter requires special attention**.
